# ðŸ“š Resources Branch â€“ GenAI_Study

Welcome to the **Resources** branch of the `GenAI_Study` repository.  
This branch is a curated collection of topics, study materials, course outlines, research papers, and book recommendations across the core domains of **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

---

## ðŸ”° Purpose

To provide a **comprehensive learning reference** for:
- Building a strong foundation in ML/DL/NLP
- Preparing for advanced concepts in LLMs and Generative AI
- Complementing hands-on coding with rigorous academic understanding
- Keeping track of whatâ€™s been covered and what remains

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each folder within this branch is dedicated to one topic:

Resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ ML/ â†’ Traditional Machine Learning
â”œâ”€â”€ DL/ â†’ Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, etc.)
â”œâ”€â”€ NLP/ â†’ NLP fundamentals and pipelines
â”œâ”€â”€ LLM/ â†’ Transformers, attention, pretraining, finetuning, RAG, etc.


Inside each folder:

- `topics.md` â€” A checklist of essential topics to study
- `papers_books.md` â€” Recommended reading (papers, chapters, etc.)
- (Optional) `courses.md` â€” Notable online courses and video resources

## ðŸ“˜ Suggested Study Order

1. **ML/** â€” Supervised, Unsupervised, Ensemble learning  
2. **DL/** â€” Neural Networks, CNNs, optimization, regularization  
3. **NLP/** â€” Embeddings, sequence modeling, language tasks  
4. **LLM/** â€” Transformers, pretraining, fine-tuning, prompting, RAG, alignment

## ðŸ§­ How to Use

- Clone the repo and switch to the `Resources` branch
- Navigate to each folder and study the `topics.md` as your checklist
- Use `papers_books.md` for deeper dives when needed
- Update your progress, add personal notes or summaries

---

## ðŸš€ Additional Ideas (Optional)

- Use `progress.md` to log what youâ€™ve covered and when
- Include `.ipynb` notebooks if you're experimenting with code alongside theory
- Bookmark useful YouTube videos or online lectures for each topic
